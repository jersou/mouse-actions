# Mouse actions

![mouse_actions_logo.svg](mouse_actions_logo.svg)
[![Build](https://github.com/jersou/mouse-actions/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jersou/mouse-actions/actions)

mouse_actions allows to execute some commands from mouse events such as:

* clicks / wheel on the side / corners of the screen,
* or drawing shapes.

It's a mix between [Easystroke](https://github.com/thjaeger/easystroke)
and [Compiz edge
commands](http://wiki.compiz.org/CCSM#Mouse_Buttons).

For instance, you can configure:

* a click in the top left corner of the screen to go to the first desktop,
* a middle click on the top side of the screen to play/pause the media,
* scroll from the left side to increase/decrease the brightness of the
  screen,
* scroll from the top-left corner to increase/decrease the volume,
* draw a `T` with the mouse right button pressed to open a terminal,
* draw a `G` with the mouse right button pressed to open a text editor (gedit),

## Features

Bind command execution with mouse button/wheel events (this conditions bellow
are optional):

* Shape drawing with the mouse (like Easystroke)
* Press/release only or click (don't propagate the press & release event)
* With some modifiers : shift/Ctrl/Alt...
* With screen edge : Top/Left...
* Auto reload config on changes
* Very low resource usage
    * Fast shape recognition : ~200µs (0.0002 sec) for a config with 30 shapes
    * Fast event without shape processing : ~30µs (0.00003 sec)
    * CPU : ~7 sec CPU usage per hour (~0.2%)
    * RAM : 5.6 Mo (GUI less version)
* Works under Wayland but with limitations, see the "Platform compatibility"
  section below.

## Project status

**⚠️ Alpha version ⚠️**

My feedback on Linux/X11 : after 10 month of daily use (since 15/05/2022) and
300'000 triggers, it's works well and X11 has not crashed (Unlike Easystroke
which made X11 crash every day before on my laptop).
With my usage, mouse_actions triggers commands about once/twice per minute, and
half of which by shape bindings.

## Known bugs

* when a device (like mouse or bluetooth earphone) is added, the mouse/keyboard
  modifier are locked : if Ctrl is pressed during this plug, Ctrl keep pressed.
  A workaround for me is to switch : Ctrl+Alt+F1 & Ctrl+Alt+F7.
* when a device (like mouse or bluetooth earphone ) is added, the cursor freeze
  while 2 seconds or the mouse_actions program may crash.

**→ a fix (2023-07-07) disable the detection of new devices from rdev → no
crash but new devices may not be usable with MA without restarting it**

* On PC suspend, the mouse_actions program may crash
* On wayland, the gesture button event is not propagated if there are no
  detected gesture #8.
* Under Linux with Nvidia gpu, the GUI window is blank #38, [it's an open bug
  of Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9304) but there is a
  workaround : set the env var `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`

## Install / run

[Download the release](https://github.com/jersou/mouse-actions/releases), the 2
release binaries `mouse-actions` and `mouse-actions-gui` are standalone (but use
the same configuration), the avantage of using GUI less version is the RAM
usage : 5.6 Mo vs 34 Mo.

The gui unbundled standalone binary need this packages :

* Debian/Ubuntu : libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37, libgtk-3-0
* Arch : webkit2gtk, gtk3
* Fedora : webkit2gtk3, gtk3

The AppImage and deb releases includes these dependencies.

### Release types

* mouse-actions-gui-vX.X.X.tar.gz (2 MB) : GUI version standalone binary
* mouse-actions-gui_X.X.X_amd64.AppImage (69 MB) : GUI version AppImage,
  includes webkit2gtk & gtk3
* mouse-actions-gui_X.X.X_amd64.deb (2.5 MB) : GUI deb package, includes
  webkit2gtk & gtk3 ref
* mouse-actions-vX.X.X.tar.gz (1 MB) : GUI less version standalone binary

### Build

* GUI less version : `cargo build --release`
* GUI version : `cd config-editor && npm i && npm run tauri-build`

### Requirement :

To use the main feature "grab event", you need to have the read&write permission
on `/dev/input/event*`. Check the group of `/dev/input/event*` files :

```bash
ls -al /dev/input/event*
# > crw-rw---- 1 root input /dev/input/event5
#                     ^^^^^
```

You need to add the current user to this group, usually `input` or `plugdev` :

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
# or
sudo usermod -a -G input $USER
```

Furthermore, you must have the read&write permission on `/dev/uinput`, you can
check with:

```bash
getfacl /dev/uinput
# ...
# user:<the current user>:rw-
# ...
```

If this permission is not available on the user, to add it
temporary : `sudo setfacl -m u:$USER:rw /dev/uinput` or persistent :

```bash
sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/80-mouse-actions.rules <<<'KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", TAG+="uaccess", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"'
```

You need to restart your desktop session to apply these changes.

To check the user groups and the ACL after the session restart or the reboot:

```bash
$ groups
... input ...
$ getfacl /dev/uinput
# ...
# user:<the current user>:rw-
# ...
```

**⚠️ The changes introduced by this chapter may cause security problems:
an application launched with your user can listen to your input events ⚠️**

### Platform compatibility

I only tested it on Linux + X11 and Linux + Wayland, but it should work on Mac,
Windows.

The `grab` feature from rdev give an inaccurate mouse position, so Mouse_actions
used the `listen` feature from rdev. This function not works on Wayland and the
listen feature is used to detect edge of screen click, so this edge actions
doesn't works on Wayland (no absolute mouse position).

#### Wayland

Notes:

* Edge screen event doesn't work with Wayland.
* but the mouse shape actions works !
* #8 `Gesture button is 'stolen' on Wayland`, this bug should be fixed in the
  future
* xdotool doesn't work on Wayland, use ydotool or other alternatives to simulate
  keyboard event.

## Configuration

### config editor

Run `mouse-actions-gui` to edit the configuration.

### Configuration file format

The config file default path is `~/.config/mouse-actions.json`

#### Structure

* `shape_button`: the mouse button to use to draw shapes :
  `Left` | `Right` | `Middle` | `Side` | `Extra` | `Forward` | `Back`
  | `Task` | `Trigger` | `Thumb` | `Thumb2` | `WheelUp` | `WheelDown`
  | `Unknown` | `None`

* `bindings` : array of binding :
    * `cmd_str` : command line to exec
    * `event`: object :
        * `button`: `Left` | `Right` | `Middle` | `Side` | `Extra` | `Forward`
          | `Back`
          | `Task` | `Trigger` | `Thumb` | `Thumb2` | `WheelUp` | `WheelDown`
          | `Unknown` | `None`
        * `edges`: array of : `Top`,`Right`,`Bottom`,`Left`,
        * `event_type`: `Press` | `Release`| `Click`
        * `modifiers`: array of :  `ShiftLeft`, `ShiftRight`, `ControlLeft`,
          `ControlRight`, `MetaLeft`, `Alt`, `AltGr`
        * `shapes_xy`: the shapes, array of arrays of coordinates. The best
          shape match will be used.

## Development

This project use [rdev crate](https://crates.io/crates/rdev) that
use [Evdev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evdev) to grab mouse Event.

### Motivations

* I used [Easystroke](https://github.com/thjaeger/easystroke) a lot but its
  development stopped in 2014, and it causes my system to crash regularly.
* Besides, I was also using a lot Compiz screen corner command bindings, and I
  wanted to have these bindings without necessarily using compiz.

The goal of this project is then to have these 2 features without having
OS crash (X11 crash).

### Dev notes :

#### Shape recognition

Shape recognition : compare angles, get the average of the angles differences :

![shape-recognition.svg](shape-recognition.svg)

The calculated difference is approximately the area between the 2 curves of
angles (mod 2𝜋) visible on the right of the above image.

Get the minimum difference by shifting a curve horizontally: try removing the
beginning or the end, by +/- 10 % max offset (max 20 try).

#### upgrade

```bash
cargo update
cargo audit
cargo test
cargo build --release

cd config-editor
npm install @tauri-apps/cli@latest @tauri-apps/api@latest

cd src-tauri
cargo update
cargo audit
```

## TODO

### High

* #8 Gesture button is 'stolen' on Wayland
* config file for /dev/input/event* in /etc/udev/rules.d/? instead of the
  usermod if possible, script to create this file, add to the deb package, ...

### Medium

* CI: build the releases https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action
* change config : if shape → (no need button in binding) or (rm shape_btn :
  several button for shape event is then possible)
* cancel shape if no move after few ms (400 ms ?)
* fix `TODO` and `FIXME`
* fix rdev
    * reset the modifiers/button state at root loop restart
    * fix rdev devices delete/update: the FIXME "inotify CREATE but not DELETE
      in grab::inotify_devices()" in rdev/src/linux/grab.rs:493
    * pull request/contribute/modify rdev without fork it in this repo (
      mouse btn add & fix devices setup/Delete notify)
* add ARM64 target #6

### Low

* re-enable the new device detection, disabled by the v0.4.4
* support Windows & macOS
* fix exec cmd not found
  error
  `Err(Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" })`
* create ~/.config if it doesn't exist
* use https://github.com/hoodie/notify-rust
* a better Readme
* improve shape recognition
* refactor
    * don't use arrayvec ?
    * reduce clone() usages
    * handle errors correctly : remove panic, reduce unwrap
    * refactor Arc/Mutex usages
    * refactor/change the pressState usage
    * dev doc, tests
* use rdev send() ? → cmd OR sendKeys in bindings (or autopilot-rs) :  trigger
  keyboard event as action (avoid xdotool usage in
  cmd) : https://github.com/Narsil/rdev#sending-some-events
* check [Tauri issue](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9304) for #38

### Maybe

* use https://crates.io/crates/deno_task_shell to execute commands ?
* release a debug version and a gui-less version ?
* options
    * dry-run option
    * min diff shape config option
    * min score shape config option
* find a better project name and icon
* notif/sound/cursor change on action trigger success/failure (
  configurable) ? https://crates.io/crates/rodio
* mouse move edge event ?
* hide/freeze cursor while shape drawing ?
* Ctrl alias for ControlLeft & ControlRight, Shift for ShiftLeft & ShiftRight,
